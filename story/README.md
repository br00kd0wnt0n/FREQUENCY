# FREQUENCY - Story Bible

## Overview

FREQUENCY is a narrative mystery experience delivered through a simulated CB/ham radio interface. Players scan frequencies to discover AI-driven characters and cryptic signals, engaging in voice conversations to uncover a central mystery.

## The Mystery

**One year ago, Marcus Hale disappeared.**

He was a radio enthusiast, known across the local frequencies. In the weeks before his disappearance, he became obsessed with signals he claimed to be picking up from the old radio tower on Miller's Ridge - a tower that hadn't been operational in decades.

The night he vanished, there were reports of strange lights at the tower. His radio equipment was found still powered on, tuned to an unusual frequency. Marcus was never seen again.
